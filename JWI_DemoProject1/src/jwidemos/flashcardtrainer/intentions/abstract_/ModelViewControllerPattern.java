    description {{
         The Model-View-Controller pattern is a structure that helps
         organize the user interface code into separate components.
         The separation of concerns helps improve understandability
         and modifiability.

         The model consists of a representation of the application's data.
         The model notifies listeners (typically, one or more view
         components) when the data changes.

         The view component presents the data to the user in the form of
         UI components. Multiple views based on the same model may exist.

         The controller acts upon input from the user and updates the
         model and/or interacts with the view.
